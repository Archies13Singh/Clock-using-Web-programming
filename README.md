LOGIC USED TO MAKE CLOCK USING HTML-CSS-JAVASCRIPT

FORMULA :

Hour hand logic : In 12hrs the hour-hand moves for 360° i.e 360/12=30°/hr
                                htime = 30 * hr + m/2
                                
Minute : 1hr has 60 min so for completing 1hr minute-hand takes 360° rotation i.e 6°/min
                                mtime = 6 * min
                                
Seconds : 1min has 60 sec so for completing 1min second-hand takes 360 rotation i.e 6°/sec
                                stime = 6° sec
